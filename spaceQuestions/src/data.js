    question: "Are there different types of black holes?",
    answer:"Yes, there are different types of black holes. The most straightforward way to classify black holes is according to their mass. You may think that because a black hole is in essence just a clump of matter that is dense enough to trap light, black holes of all masses should exist."

    question: "Can a star turn into a planet?",
    answer:"Yes, a star can turn into a planet, but this transformation only happens for a very particular type of star known as a brown dwarf. Some scientists do not consider brown dwarfs to be true stars because they do not have enough mass to ignite the nuclear fusion of ordinary hydrogen."

    question: "Can gravity form waves?",
    answer:"Yes, gravity can forms waves. Gravitational waves are ripples in spacetime that travel through the universe. If you think of gravity as a force acting at a distance, it is difficult to visualize how gravitational waves could form."

    question: "Does every black hole contain a singularity?",
    answer: "In the real universe, no black holes contain singularities. In general, singularities are the non-physical mathematical result of a flawed physical theory. When scientists talk about black hole singularities, they are talking about the errors that appear in our current theories and not about objects that actually exist."

    question: "Does sound travel faster in space?",
    answer: "Sound does not travel at all in space. The vacuum of outer space has essentially zero air. Because sound is just vibrating air, space has no air to vibrate and therefore no sound. If you are sitting in a space ship and another space ship explodes, you would hear nothing."
